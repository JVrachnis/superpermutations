# superpermutations
algorithms to generate superpermutations

all my scripts are based on the greedy algorithm

try running 'python3 spm2.py n' (n is the size of the set to permutate) where n in (0-11), n=12 is very heavy for this algorithm

i will an other algorithm (in c++ and python3) that can handly memory wise all sizes but hasnt checks to see if the superpermutations is correct

i will add an algorithm that will produce all the superpermutations of n size based on the greedy algorithm
